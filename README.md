Pathfinding Builder is an application where the user can control the position of a starting node and a target node on a grid. The user can also add walls and custom weighted areas to control the environment of the grid. There are multiple pathfinding algorithms that can be visualized to see how they work and the path that they create. The pathfinding algorithmns include: Breadth-first search, Depth-first Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.
